There is three different projects located in this repository.

1. A plain Unity-Python communication with a clean Unity scene.
2. A Unity scene with a robot setup for computer vision/navigation and Unity-Python communication.
3. A Unity scene with a humanoid rig and Unity-Python communication.


The Python code is made with Python 3.6 and needs one library called zmq, which you can use pip to install.
